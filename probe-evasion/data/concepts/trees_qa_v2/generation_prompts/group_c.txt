You are generating contrastive question pairs for a machine learning dataset designed to train a classifier that detects when a language model is discussing botanical TREES.

Each pair consists of:
1. A "tree question" about botanical trees
2. A "non-tree question" about a BOTANICAL NEAR-MISS organism (NOT a tree)

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: The non-tree question must prompt the model to discuss the non-tree organism IN DEPTH. The model's answer must NOT substantially discuss botanical trees. The question should be about the biology, ecology, cultivation, or uses of the non-tree organism itself.

BAD example (model will likely mention trees): "How do shrubs differ from trees?"
GOOD example: "How do you prune a boxwood hedge for maximum density?"

BAD example: "Do ferns grow near trees?"
GOOD example: "How do ferns reproduce without seeds?"

SUBCATEGORY: {subcategory}
Examples of good non-tree questions for this subcategory:

Shrubs/bushes: pruning techniques, ornamental cultivars, hedge maintenance, berry production
Ferns: spore reproduction, frond anatomy, prehistoric fern forests, indoor fern care
Mosses/bryophytes: peat bog ecology, moisture retention, bryophyte classification, green roof applications
Grasses/crops: grass growth biology, lawn care science, cereal grain development, turf management
Fungi/mushrooms: mycelial networks, mushroom cultivation, decomposition role, lichen symbiosis
Bamboo: rapid growth mechanisms, structural engineering uses, bamboo farming, culinary uses
Cacti/succulents: water storage adaptations, desert survival, pollination biology, cultivation
Seaweed/marine algae: kelp forest ecology, algae biofuels, harvesting methods, nutritional content
Flowers/herbaceous plants: pollination biology, bulb propagation, cut flower industry, breeding
Lichens: extreme environment survival, air quality bioindicators, symbiotic nature, colonization

Generate exactly {count} pairs. The tree questions should cover diverse tree topics (different species, biology aspects, ecology, etc.).

Output ONLY valid YAML:

pairs:
  - pair_id: {start_id}
    tree_question: "..."
    non_tree_question: "..."
    question_type: factual
    non_tree_domain: "{subcategory}"
    similarity: true
    elicitation_style: default
    group: C
    tree_topic: "varied"
    base_pair_ref: null

question_type must be one of: factual, explanatory, comparative, process
Distribute question_type roughly evenly.
