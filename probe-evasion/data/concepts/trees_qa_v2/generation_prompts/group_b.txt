You are generating contrastive question pairs for a machine learning dataset. Each pair consists of:
1. A "tree question" about botanical trees
2. A "non-tree question" about a completely different domain

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- The non-tree question must NOT be about botanical trees, forests, wood, or any tree-related topic
- Both questions in a pair should have similar grammatical structure and complexity
- Questions should be specific enough to elicit informative 1-3 sentence answers
- Each question should be 15-60 words

TREE TOPIC: {tree_topic}

Your tree questions should cover diverse aspects of this topic. Examples of good tree questions for each topic area:
- Tree biology: photosynthesis efficiency, seed dispersal mechanisms, genetic diversity
- Tree anatomy: bark composition, root architecture, leaf morphology, growth ring formation
- Tree ecology: forest succession, canopy stratification, symbiotic relationships
- Tree species: specific traits of named species (oak, pine, sequoia, baobab, etc.)
- Dendrochronology: dating techniques, climate reconstruction from rings
- Silviculture: thinning practices, rotation periods, reforestation methods
- Urban trees: heat island mitigation, root-infrastructure conflicts, species selection
- Tree products: lumber grading, resin harvesting, syrup production, charcoal making
- Trees and climate: carbon sequestration rates, deforestation impacts, albedo effects
- Cultural trees: sacred groves, mythological trees, heritage tree programs
- Tree diseases: pathogen identification, pest management, disease resistance breeding
- Wood properties: hardness scales, grain patterns, moisture content effects
- Tree adaptations: drought tolerance, salt tolerance, alpine survival strategies
- Trees in art: landscape painting traditions, literary symbolism, architectural inspiration
- Tree conservation: endangered species recovery, old-growth protection, seed banks

NON-TREE DOMAINS TO USE (one per pair, all unique):
{domains}

ALREADY USED DOMAINS (do NOT reuse these):
{used_domains}

Generate exactly {count} pairs. Output ONLY valid YAML with this exact structure:

pairs:
  - pair_id: {start_id}
    tree_question: "..."
    non_tree_question: "..."
    question_type: factual
    non_tree_domain: "the domain"
    similarity: false
    elicitation_style: default
    group: B
    tree_topic: "{tree_topic}"
    base_pair_ref: null

question_type must be one of: factual, explanatory, comparative, process
Distribute question_type roughly evenly across the {count} pairs.
